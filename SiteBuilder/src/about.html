  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
    This site archives the messages, photos and files from the Bug HLG Yahoo! Groups mailing list.
    The list was active between 2002 and 2018. When Yahoo discontinued its public groups at the end of 2019, the Bug HLG
    mailing list was set to disappear from the internet for good.
  </p>
  <p>
    I retrieved the group's content on December 12, 2019 using the
    <tt><a href="https://github.com/IgnoredAmbience/yahoo-group-archiver">yahoo-group-archiver</a></tt> script. You can download the
    raw retrieved data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bbgx0G7ypcw24t5p_nXIFEGxlxq1Jfk3">here</a>
    or <a href="/bughlg.tar.gz">here</a> (171 MB). I used an ad-hoc tool to read
    the script's data files and build the minimalistic site you are viewing now. I'll write more about the process in a blog post later.
  </p>
  <p>
    In publishing this archive, it is my understanding that all of this content (e-mail messages, files and photos) were put
    into the public domain by their authors when they contributed to the original group. I hope all the great stuff on here will add to the
    fun and enjoyment of RC builders for many years to come.
