  <h2>About this site</h2>
  <p>
    This site archives the messages, photos and files from the Bug HLG Yahoo! Groups mailing list.
    The list was active between 2002 and 2018. When Yahoo discontinued its public groups at the end of 2019, the Bug HLG
    mailing list was set to disappear from the internet for good.
  </p>
  <p>
    I retrieved the group's content on December 12, 2019 using the <tt>yahoo-group-archiver</tt> script (Github repository
    <a href="https://github.com/IgnoredAmbience/yahoo-group-archiver">here</a>). I wrote a custom tool to read
    the script's data files and build the minialistic site you are viewing now.
    I'll write more about the process in a blog post later.

    Enjoy the Bug HLG site, and good thermals! If you feel like it, drop me a line at gabor.reads.this [at] gmail - dot - com.
