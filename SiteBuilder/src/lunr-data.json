I made a copy of both wing \r\nsections and taped the third rib on one down over the forth rib on \r\nthe other. That way I had the same rib spacing. I also used .056 FG \r\ncloth on the wing tips. I just sprayed adhesive on the tips and \r\nsmoothed out the glass. Then I dropped thin CA on it for a really \r\nstrong wing tip. I also ran the CF tube to the tip. I then sanded the \r\ntube to feather it down smooth at the tip. I added thick CA in the \r\nopen tube where I had sanded it. I can't tell any difference in the \r\nwing strength. The wing is not that noticeably larger than my \r\noriginal but it sure floats more. The five inches that was added is \r\nclose to the cord so the % of area added is considerable. I doubt \r\nthat I will ever build another wing without the added rib.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Mods made are to accommodate a wider range of equipment and to be able to fit them in the fuselage. It's only a slight modification on the LightninBug design. With all the right options used(tried them all). So far I find it a real good performer, with a dead air time of 1:00 to 1:12 for a really lazy launch. Out of the kits already built, the flying weight comes out to +- 120 grams almost every time, which suits this model really well. It handles wind quite well and finding thermals aren't all that hard. A friend was able to find a thermal on his first ever flight with a DLglider and flew an extra 40s on his first launch\u0085\r\n\r\nCovering I would suggest is laminate covering. We've built two models, one covered with solarfilm and the other with laminate covering. The solarfilm model was able to take three hard launches before it tore apart. The laminate version on the other hand has now got about +- 200 launches, many cartwheels(ground and flying into things) and a few solid nose-in's and nothing has shown any breakage. So for my kits I supply laminate covering with normal covering only for the wing tips (Red, blue, silver, checker).\r\n\r\nThings that need to be remembered: This is a fun glider\u0085 It isn't the best performer or a competition class glider. It's a fun, economical, easy and fast to build glider that flies great and is a blast to fly\u0085\r\nThe build can easily be finished in 3 nights. (1h per wing half, 1h for fuselage and tale and 1h for control rods and finishing)\r\n\r\nThis model is about fun flying with buddies, doing crazy things(limbo, formation, light contact) and still having the performance to do it all\u0085\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nGerrit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the African Bug folder under photos\u0085\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"paulmccaughey79\" <paul_mccaughey@...> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> hi,\r\n> i tried to message yesterday but it looks like it never got sent/posted.\r\n> \r\n> i might be interested in this kit. i want a bug but i am useless at cutting out balsa so laser cut kit/parts would be great. there are laser parts for a revised plan also being sold so i want to evaluate yours a bit more.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> what version of plans is it based on? is it the lightening bug or your own version? if it's your own version what modifications have you made? do you have pictures of the completed model?\r\n> \r\n> also what covering is it you provide and what colour is it? \r\n> \r\n> thanks\r\n> Paul \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> --- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"cronselaar\" <cronselaar@> wrote:\r\n> >\r\n> > Hi,\r\n> > Just to let everyone know.

This allowed the spar to be inserted from the tip inboard and reinforce the inside of the hole as well.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to go was the LE to Rib attach points.

I appreciate being warned about scams.Awhile back I ordered some foam mini jets from a person and after many weeks of waiting I posted a complaint on RC groups and found 3 or 4 pages of other complaints about the same person. I did get some of my money back but not all of it because he was making me scaled down versions of the ones he offered.

In fact, I went to the Down East Soaring Society \r\nthermal duration contest and consistently outlaunched a Taboo ($400 \r\nfoam & fg hlg).  Granted, this was an open class contest and it was \r\njust four of us messing with hlg's afterwards.  My launches are full-\r\ndiscus as hard as I can throw.  The Bug tracks straight up with no \r\nelevator preset, and tracks supurb with a hair down and right rudder \r\nlaunch preset.\r\n\r\nYes, the boom is somewhat flimsier than the 3/16\"  HOWEVER, only \r\nduring launches does the tail see enough air to deflect the boom.  \r\nMost flights do not produce enough force on the tail to deflect the \r\n1/8\" boom.  I still have enough control authority to pull loops, \r\nanother high-force on the tail manover.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the decreased weight has helped too.  My times have \r\ndefinitely increased.  I flew a 3:23 after the DESS contest, second \r\nflight of the day.  My best time of 4:30 was also done with the 1/8\" \r\ntail and cruciform setup.\r\n\r\nRemember to keep the tail light!  With the extra long moment arm, \r\nweight becomes an issue.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents' worth.

He has done some great innovations.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI've been reading the comments about both planes and thought \r\nthere must be a way to settle this. Here's the result: Combine a \r\nBug wing stretched 5\" (2 extra #3 ribs), a LN pod and boom and \r\na Drela inspired crucifrom tail and you have the \"Lil' Bugger\"! \r\n(Rich Davies was also thinking along this line.) My apologies to \r\nany european or Australian members who might use a different \r\ndefinition for the word.\r\n\r\nIt has a 34\" span, 17\" Skyshark 2P boom, modified LN pod, \r\nGWS Pico Rx, HS55 servos & 2 CR Lithiums for power. AUW - \r\n3.5 ounces. I've posted the photos in a new folder.\r\n\r\nBuilding report: The Bug wing is a breeze. I photo-copied the ribs \r\nfrom the plan and went to work. All balsa is Poly-treated, per LN \r\ntypical construction. The details on how to stretch the wing are \r\non the Bug site. I also filled in the left wing tip w/contest grade \r\nbalsa to make a good thumb pad. The servos are recessed into \r\nthe wing and mounted on an extended boom brace as \r\ndescribed in other LN posts. The pod is a basic LN pod \r\nmodified to allow the boom to exit under the wing. The tail is just \r\na personal preference. Mark Drela has designed several \r\noutstanding planes using this shape and I've had great success \r\nwith it in the past. Light weight and perfectly straight launches. \r\nIt \r\nalso lands in the grass nicely w/o catching due to it's +/- ratio. \r\nThe horiz. stab is a new design that pops off w/o tools. Quite \r\nslick.\r\n\r\nFlight report: I initially tried some 170mAh NiMH's, but found the \r\nplane to be tail heavy and went back to the trusty CR2's. I launch \r\nthe plane using an underhand SAL (thumb on top of the wing) \r\nand was easily over fifty feet on the first try. Practice will add \r\nmore height. It launches straight w/o using a gyro and does very \r\nwell in calm winds. I can ballast it for higher winds, but I don't \r\nhave any experience with the Bug airfoil's ability to penetrate. \r\nTime will tell. \r\n\r\nFeel free to comment. The pictures can be found in the Photos \r\nsection in the Lil' Bugger folder.

I bought LM 78 L05 1.5A voltage regulator, for 1.50 PLN, but again bad luck, because they do not have miniature capacitors in the store ceramicznych 330nF i 100nF / I did not want to buy \"kulfonów / and the case is standing.

Take your 1/16\" sheet stock, drench a paper \r\ntowel in poly and soak the sheet on both sides (important to \r\navoid cupping). By the time you are done soaking take a clean \r\npaper towel and start rubbing the poly into the wood while \r\nrubbing the excess off at the same time. \r\n\r\nThis forces the poly into the wood fibers and creates a \r\ncomposite material. When both sides are wiped down stand the \r\nsheet on one edge to dry. It should dry straight every time in only \r\na couple of hours. If there is some cupping, press under books \r\nbetween some plastic wrap overnight.  The water evaporates \r\nleaving only the poly molecules and adds little weight.\r\n\r\nYou can then cut out your parts and sand to shape. Here's the \r\ngreat part. The poly changes the balsa fibers enough that they \r\nare now attracted to the bench instead of floating into the air! \r\n\r\nI then take .75 oz glass and just lay it over the finished piece. I \r\ntake my thin CA or thinned wood glue and just drip it onto the \r\nsurface. The glass wets out and you can wipe off any excess \r\nwith a paper towel. Instant sandwich!  You can even reduce \r\nglass coverage to the high stress areas and then treat the balsa \r\nedges with CA or Elmer's for a nice hard edge.\r\n\r\nYou can try this for the cost of a small can of WATER BASED \r\npoly at the home enter.

I created a Taboo like tail \r\nsetup and used heavier wire to eliminate all but 1/32\" of slop.  My \r\nvertical and horizontal are approximately 50% control surface and \r\n50% stabilizer.  A 1/8\" boom at 13.5 inches long drives the CG aft, \r\nnecessitating two nickels of nose weight.\r\n\r\nAfter working out the launch preset (right rudder and down \r\nelevator), I started using full discus launches using my wing peg.  \r\nImmediately, I noticed launches are equivilently high to college \r\nbaseball field light poles (80 ft?).  Working on the preset a \r\nlittle, a few launches were higher.\r\n\r\nGranted, it was 5:30pm and the sun was almost set, I caught a \r\nthermal without meaning to, stuck with it, and pulled off a two \r\nminute flight.  A few other flights were over 1:30.  My dead air \r\ntimes are around 45 seconds, around 1:00 with a good launch.  \r\n\r\nControl is good.  The rudder doesn't bank the plane like my old Bug \r\n(also a whopping 6\" dihedral), but it is sufficient.  Rudder \r\nauthority is not a problem with low winds, however.  A few small \r\nwind gusts did give my rudder trouble, but a touch of down and \r\nrudder banked the plane without a problem.  Elevator is more than \r\nplenty.  Perhaps too much elevator even - I did four consecutive \r\nloops off of a shallow dive.\r\n\r\nI was expiromenting with thermal circling when my radio battery \r\ndied.  I had been programming in the mixes for so long while \r\nbuilding that my battery ran down.  \r\n\r\nMy verdict is an emphatic \"Try the extended wing!\"  The ex-Bug may \r\nnot be mosquito class legal, but launches with $400 composite DHLG \r\nheight with a much nicer price tag.  \r\n\r\nI will post pictures this evening when I have access to a camera.\r\n\r\nDan\r\n\r\n\r\nPS  I have a feeling that a launch preset should be right rudder and \r\nup elevator.

When you\r\nposted your comments about using the 1/8\" carbon tube,\r\nI was skeptical to the max.  I have just recently\r\nfinished a modescomprehensivesive survey of available\r\ncarbon shafts, and how they might be used on our\r\nDLG's.  I have an outlet fairly nearby that has most\r\nbrands.  Below are some of my findings and comments. \r\nAll weights are for ~32.5 inch long shafts.\r\n\r\n1. Avia Sport G-Force- ~12.5 gr.  This is a tapered\r\nshaft.  The large end has a slight bell (for about\r\n2.25&#accommodatecomodate joining another shaft to it.\r\n The surface is rippled from the spiral winding at\r\nlayup time.  It can be sanded smooth for better\r\naerodynamics and to be a bit lighter.  It's a very\r\ngrave health hazard to sand this stuff, so take\r\nappropriate precautions.  The shaft is fairly stiff. \r\nCertainly much more so than 1/8 tubing.  The cost\r\naround here is about $15.\r\n\r\n2.  Avia G-Sport- Skinny.  ~8 gr.  REALLY light and\r\nstrong.  Most of the above applies here.  Not quite as\r\nstiff as above, but still quite so.  Could be a great\r\ncontest shaft.  I have an idea or two on how to\r\nstiffen it much more with only a gram or so of weight\r\npenalty.  More on that after I have had time to\r\nexperiment. I think the large (or even a cut from the\r\nmiddle somewhere) end would be perfectly appropriate\r\nfor most micros.  Price about the same as above.\r\n\r\n3.  Sky Shark-5P 'White tip'.  ~15gr.  This is my\r\nfavorite for the following reasons.  It is\r\n1/4\"-untapered, which means that one shaft could be\r\nused for 2 planes, most of the time.  It's quite a bit\r\nstiffer than either of the above.  It's surface has\r\nalready been ground smooth.  Even though it's a little\r\nheavier than the above, a 12\" boom only comes in at\r\nabout 5.5 gr., Less than 1/2 the weight of std. 1/4\"\r\ncarbon tube, and nearly as stiff.  One of the best\r\nfeatures is that it only costs about $8/shaft!\r\n\r\n4.  I weighed and flexed MANY different Beamon arrow\r\nshafts.  I didn't feel that ANY were appropriate for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nI did find some other VERY interesting, inexpensive\r\nshafts that I bought but have not been able to find\r\nout the mfgr yet.  I also bought some larger, longer\r\nshafts.  If anybody is interested, I can give more\r\ndetail on them offline.  I also have a couple of\r\nAppogee and Bubble Dancer booms from Tail-Boom.  They\r\nare truly works of art, but to large and heavy and\r\nexpensive for micros.  By the way, my current micro\r\nshould come out (all up including radio, battery, etc)\r\nat about 2.5 oz.  I've designed the wing to be strong\r\nenough to handle a full pedal, zoomie, winch launch. \r\nIt shouldn't have a problem with DL, either.  I have\r\nplans to make it a full 4 servo ship in the near\r\nfuture--with little to no weight penalty!  All\r\nstandard balsa-carbon construction.  I just don't like\r\nthe foam crud.  I did get bagged last night, though!! \r\nWe'll see...\r\n\r\nPhil \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- \"Dan <djedward@...>\"\r\n<djedward@...> wrote:\r\n> I know I advertised the 1/8\" carbon tailboom to be\r\n> adaquate enough \r\n> for our application on the Bugs -- I was wrong.\r\n> \r\n> I watched the Down East Soaring Society's (DESS)\r\n> first HLG \r\n> competition a few weekends ago and none other than\r\n> Joe Wurts had \r\n> flown in from California.

It's 1.25 meter span gives it a much lower wing\r\nloading than the bug and it's S3021 airfoil is thinner than the bug's which\r\nlet's you cover much more ground looking for thermals. It's superior, but\r\nthat's to be expected since I didn't have to keep my span under .75 meters\r\nto be Mosquito class legal.\r\n\r\nThe Bug can be built from $6.00 plans and is a great starting HLG. The\r\nGambler is the obvious 'next step'.\r\n\r\nThe Taboo, or any composite DLG in that class will outperform the Gambler by\r\n2x or more both in lanuch and penetration. But starting at $450 vs $65 for\r\nthe Gambler, you're still getting a good 'bang for the buck' with the \r\nGambler.\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn: The Bug\r\nIf you have a Bug and want to go up a step: The Gambler\r\nIf you want competition class performance: Taboo, XP3, Sidewinder, etc.\r\n\r\nI Own a Taboo, but haven't flown it too much in the winter conditions \r\nhere in New England.

It says to use 1/16\", but it seems like it needs something to stiffen and harder up the wood for a slightly more robust tail group. I was thinking of thinning out some white glue and painting it on then giving it a light sanding, is this necessary?\r\n\r\nI haven't made the (+) tail on any of my bugs, but here's a technique that\r\nI've used to toughen up 1/16 sheet flying surfaces.\r\n\r\ncut 2 pieces of 2-ounce fiberglass cloth, a little bigger than the surface\r\nto be strengthened. Spray lightly one side of each piece of cloth with \r\n3-M Super 77 spray adhesive. Apply the cloth to the surface making sure\r\nthat it's nice and smooth and the part is not in tension (warped) at\r\nall. Mix some 30-minute finishing epoxy (I use\r\nZ-poxy, but Wes systems, etc. is fine.) Squeegee some epoxy onto the \r\ncloth, then squeegee as much as you can out of the cloth.\r\n\r\nPlace a sheet of wax paper onto a flat surface, then the piece of glassed\r\nbalsa, then another piece of wax paper, then a piece of 1/4\" plywood. The\r\ngood aircraft kind with no grain to the surface. Then weight down with a good\r\nweight, like several cinder blocks - you want 20 lbs. or so.\r\n\r\nLet cure a couple hours. When you're done you'll need to trim the excess cloth\r\nfrom the part and sand the edges round/square/tapered as necessary.\r\n\r\nAlways do both sides of any part at once or you'll end up with a potato \r\nchip. Also be sure to let the part fully cure - I go 4 times the cure time\r\nrated on the epoxy, overnight if possible.\r\n\r\nIf you want a lighter surface with less added strength, you can use\r\n.75 oz. cloth, but at that point you're not much stronger than a good \r\napplication of monokote.\r\n\r\nAl\r\n\r\n\r\n===============================================================================\r\nAllan Wright Jr.            | Without love life's just a long fight - Southside\r\nUniversity of New Hampshire +--------------------------------------------------\r\nResearch Computing Center   | WWI Modeling mailing list: wwi@...\r\nInternet: aew@...       | WWI Modeling WWW Page: http://www.wwi-models.org\r\n===============================================================================","authorName":"Allan Wright","date":"January 16, 2003 1:57 PM"},{"id":153,"subject":"(No subject)","body":"Mike and Paul,\r\n\r\nYou both asked about strengthening the balsa for a cruciform tail \r\n(great looking model by the way).\r\n\r\nI was also skeptical about using 1/16\", but figured I might as well \r\nstart light and replace and beef things up if needed.

You want to wet the glass but you also want to remove \r\n as much epoxy as you can.\r\nLift up an edge of the fiberglass (I've used both tweezers or the S.E. \r\nrazor blade)and peel up and towards the opposite edge of the glass.  \r\nYou'll notice that some of the epoxy remains on the wax paper.\r\nPlace the side of the fiberglass that was against the wax paper onto \r\nthe tail surface.  \r\nUse the razor blade (or your finger wrapped in a piece of wax paper) \r\nto press the glass onto the surface of the tail surface. \r\nPlace the tail surface wrapped with wax paper (glass on top) on \r\nclipboard. Place about four layers of paper towels on top. Place \r\na large telephone book. Add either more books or weights.  Leave \r\nseveral hours minimum if not overnight.  Trim. Glass should conform to \r\nrounded edges (that's why I use the paper towels and flexible \r\ntelephone books.).  \r\n\r\nRepeat for other side.\r\n\r\nThe trick to this method is that when you pull the epoxy \r\nwetted fiberglass from the wax paper, about a third of the epoxy stays \r\non the wax paper and at the same time the remaining epoxy is pulled to \r\nthe lower fiberglass surface through the weave.  \r\nThe surface produced is not glass smooth. You can feel the weave of \r\nthe glass. The epoxy is being used to glue the fiberglass to the balsa \r\nand this results in the minimum amount of epoxy being used and \r\ntherefore less weight. \r\nThe only problem with this method is that it might take some practice \r\nto remove the wetted fiberglass from the wax paper without tearing it. \r\n I've even done it with .75 ounce fiberglass but it's tricky. \r\n\r\nTo minimize the weight, I only glass the fin and stab, since the \r\nrudder and elevator are supported by them.\r\nMake the bottom surface of the fin stick down slightly lower than the \r\nbottom surface of the rudder - minimize rudder contact with ground.  \r\nI CA a 1/32\" wide strip of .007\" thick carbon fiber to the bottom \r\nsurface of the fin that will come in contact with the ground-about an \r\ninch long.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n\r\n> I haven't made the (+) tail on any of my bugs, but here's a \r\ntechnique that\r\n> I've used to toughen up 1/16 sheet flying surfaces.\r\n> \r\n> cut 2 pieces of 2-ounce fiberglass cloth, a little bigger than the \r\nsurface\r\n> to be strengthened.

The cost of the kit is $60 plus actual shipping by US Priority Mail.  Delivery charges in the USA are around $6.00.  I'd have to check to see what mailing costs would be to NZ.

As you presumed, the vertical stab is glued on one side of the boom. Some believe the side you glue it to matters according to which wingtip you launch it from. Wouldn't you agree that you'd want the forces of the launch to pull on the linkage? If you launch with your right hand, then the forces are trying to pull you left, therefore you may need to add right rudder. So you'd put the vertical stab on the right side. I hope this line of reasoning is correct!\r\n\r\n3. I use 4x50mAh nicads. Even with the extra battery I require some weight in the nose.\r\n\r\n4. Use 1/32 sheet (crossgrain) as shown on the plans.\r\n\r\n5. Copy the ribs. Spray the back of the paper with contact adhesive (3M-77 or photo-mount work fine) and affix to your balsa sheet with the grain direction as shown on the plan. Carefully cut out with an exacto #11 blade. Remember the first rib is on the 1/8\" balsa. \r\n\r\n6. Your scroll saw will come in handy, perhaps, for the initial shaping of the balsa nose block. Or, you can shape the nose block \"on a stick\" with a small plane, progressively fine-tuning with increasing grades of sandpaper 'till you get the shape you want.

The glass \r\nis .75 oz weight and around a 3/4\" x 3/4\" piece glued with as few as \r\npossible drops of thin CA.  It's plenty strong and reinforces the \r\nweak point of the vertical.  \r\nIf you offset yours, either side is okay at this size model.  You \r\nshouldn't notice any difference on launch because you'll be all over \r\nthe rudder first few throws to get it up straight.

Mine will fly straight up even without the preset.  The \r\ntransition from extreme yawing on launch to heading up is short \r\nanyhow.

I've never had my BUG weigh over 3 oz with the original \r\nwing area. It weighed about 75g when it got away. This has been a \r\nvery consistent thermaller for me at this weight. I've got nothing \r\nbut good things to say about this bird. \r\n\r\nThere seems to have been some controversy about the use of a 1/8\" \r\ntailboom in the yahoo group. From reading the 190 or so posts, it \r\nseems that there is quite a variation in the stiffnees of \r\ncommercially available CF tube. The one I used is from CST: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cstsales.com/Carbon/carbon-rods.htm \r\n\r\nThese have been more than stiff enough for my hardest SAL/DLG. I use \r\nthe V-tail with no gyro (a little right rudder held with the left \r\nthumb on the left stick during launch) and she launches arrow \r\nstraight. I have just enough time to recover my grip on the Tx and \r\npush the nose over as she reaches her launch apex. \r\n\r\nMy full force launch is rarely over 30 feet because of the extremely \r\nlow (2.5 oz/sq. ft.) wingloading. Mind you at that weight, that's \r\nall I need to find lift. \r\n\r\nThe same trade off between weight=launch height and \r\nlightness=\"floatiness\" seems to exist even at the highest eschelon \r\nof this discipline (eg. the 11.5oz Full House Taboo competing with \r\nthe 9.5 oz composite poly owing to its higher launch as a result of \r\nits greater mass). \r\n\r\nI'm by no means an accomplished HLG pilot and I rarely--in fact I'd \r\nsay never--have a less than 2 minute flight in a typical session of \r\n10 to 20 throws.

I make a copy of the plans and cut the \r\nrib templates just a bit large. Then I used a glue stick to attach \r\nthe rib templates to the balsa. I cut the ribs rough with a hobby \r\nknife and then sanded then with a one foot sanding bar. I used a rat \r\ntail file to file in the LE radius and a small drill to do the hole. \r\nI pinned everything to a building board so when I tack the LE rod on \r\nthe first few ribs everything is solid. Then I hit it with some \r\nthick CA and let it dry for a good anchor. After that I pin the wing \r\ntip end in place and glue the rest of the ribs. That seems to work \r\nfor me. I also make two (2) double jigs (you need four pieces) for \r\nthe root rib angle. I glue a small block of balsa between two and \r\nend up with two block that I can pin to the board and it will stay \r\nin place.

I use 1/8\" \r\nbalsa w/o lightening holes since I grab the tip for SAL. I usually \r\nhave to file a groove for the spar at the tip so that the bottom \r\nsurfaces of R7 and the tip plate line up.\r\n11. Install R1 using the dihedral gauge. Remove from board and sand \r\ntop and bottom of R1 flat to the other ribs w/sanding block.\r\n12. Starting at R1, lay the 1/8\" dowel LE into the notches and secure \r\nwith CA.\r\n13. Trim dowel at tip as shown and sand to fine bevel. Fill tip with \r\nlight contest balsa and sand to match airfoil. This makes a good \r\nthumb grip for SAL. Do both sides for balance and leftie/rightie \r\ncapability.\r\n14. Install sheeting at R1-R2.\r\n15. Harden edge of tip balsa with thin CA to prevent dings.\r\n16. Repeat 1-15 for other wing.\r\n17. Glue halves, reincorce w/FG\r\n18. Cover.\r\n\r\nDifferent builders will have different methods, so take these steps \r\nas a guideline. I've built many of these wings and have had no \r\nproblems at all (my first plane is still flying in it's second season \r\nwith my kids learning to fly on this plane last year).

Your glass form should work \r\nbut may take more effort to make and if you have a fit problem \r\nwhere the pod won't slip off of the mold (don't ask) you'll have to \r\nstart all over, whereas a little more filing, sanding and bondo will \r\nsave your first wood mold.\r\n\r\nHere's how I did it:\r\n\r\nFrom the home center store purchase the following:\r\n\r\n1/2\" x 4\" x 24\" Poplar (fairly hard, smooth grain, easy to work, no \r\ngrain marks in pod.)\r\n\r\nTake a rasp and rough-in the approximate LE shape in one \r\nedge of the 1/2\" Poplar. Move to finer files and then sand paper \r\nuntil the shape is pretty good. It does not need to be exact. Cut \r\ntwo sections 3\" long with the appropriate dihedral angle and \r\nglue together with wood glue. Set aside to dry.\r\n\r\nCut the 1\" x 2\" in half  to make a 2\"x 2\"x12\". Glue these halves \r\ntogether with wood glue and set aside.\r\n\r\nDraw an approximate shape of your  pod. About  3-4\" from the LE \r\nand about 1-1/2\" behind the LE. Make the shape taper to fit your \r\nbattery diameter at the nose to about 1-1/2\" wide at the LE. From \r\nthe LE back you need to transition to where the tail boom exits in \r\na shape that will allow you to still slide the pod off the mold. A \r\ngentle taper, not too rounded. You'll know if you get this wrong \r\nwhen you have to cut the pod off of the mold. :(\r\n\r\nOnce the \"wing\" portion has dried, I sand off the \"V\" on the lower \r\nside of the dihedral joint to make a nice flat surface to accept the \r\npod portion. \r\n\r\nPlace your pod plan side view on the side of your 2\"x2\" w/o the \r\nseam. You can use the seam that runs fore and aft to make sure \r\nthat your right and left halves are the same distance from the \r\ncenter line. No matter how much you file or sand away, that \r\nseam will always show center in the right/left orientation.\r\n\r\nRasp, file and sand the basic shape paying attention to how \r\nyou'll merge the pod piece and the wing piece. The pod tends to \r\nangle down about 5-15% from horizontal. Many of our wives have \r\nreferred to pods as \"penis things\". That should give you the idea. \r\nOnce you're are done carving, glue the pod to the wing and set \r\naside. \r\n\r\nOnce this is dry you'll need some body filler (bondo) to make \r\nnice round fillets where the pod meets the wing on the \r\nunderside of the wing and where the top of the pod transitions to \r\nthe LE. The PETG will not go into sharp corners and we've found \r\nthat relying on the natural stretch of the hot PETG to approximate \r\nthose fillets leads to crappy results.\r\n\r\nSand this very smooth and let the bondo cure completely. \r\nDrill a hole chordwise into the stubbed TE of your mold and glue \r\nin a metal rod (or two) that can be clamped in your vise.\r\n\r\nI have a hobby vise that clamps to the countertop next to the \r\nstove. I clamp the rod in the vise so that the nose is pointing \r\nstraight up. Heat your PETG, pull the pod, let cool, remove, trim, \r\nsand trimmed edges, drill mounting holes, go flying! (refer to the \r\nLil' Bugger photos in the LN group to see how mine is trimmed)\r\n\r\nPrint off Bruce Kimball's pod photos in the LN group as a guide. \r\nBruce makes wind tunnel models for Boeing and is a master \r\ncraftsman. Note that the LN boom exits through the wing and not \r\nunder the wing like the Bug, so you'll have to make an allowance \r\nfor the boom to exit that doesn't show in Bruces photos.\r\n\r\nHope that helps. Believe it or not, the form is the easy part. \r\nPulling nice smooth pods that are not too thick or not too thin is \r\nthe challenge. I still feel that I could do much better. \r\n\r\nIf all else fails, call Scobie at Liftworx.com and ask him to sell \r\nyou a Seeker pod. Also - Be sure to extend your spars to the \r\nwing tip for strength. I made my first wing per plan and had to go \r\nback and reinforce it. It just couldn't take the tip launch stress.\r\n\r\nMy Lil' Bugger is on it's second full season and it spent hours \r\nbeing crashed by my 11 and 14 year olds. It has never needed \r\nmore of a repair than something I could perform at the field and \r\ngo right back to flying. I'm proud to say that crowds have \r\ngathered to figure out what my boys were crashing and then just \r\ntossing back into the air.

It takes a lot \r\nof effort and time to produce the first good pod.  You have to carve \r\na mold and learn to heat the PETG at just the right temperature and \r\nheat the plastic sheet uniformly so that you get a pod that doesn't \r\nhave thin areas.  All of this could easily become more of a project \r\nthan building the entire plane.  And when you do get a good pod you \r\nare forced to install the servos to the wing instead of a distance in \r\nfront of the wing where their weight can be used to balance the \r\nweight of the tail.  The see-thru fuse also doesn't help with making \r\nthe plane visible at altitude.  \r\nI built a balsa pod for my nipper and it was lighter even with a \r\nlayer of .75 oz. fiberglass to make it crash resistant.  I could have \r\nbuilt several balsa pods in the time it took to get a good plastic \r\npod.  I also think that installing all the radio gear in the fuse \r\nmakes it a lot neater package - one piece wing mounts to one piece \r\nfuse. \r\nThe see-thru pod is very inovative looking and this may make it \r\nworth the effort for some, but not for me.  \r\n \r\nJohn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"John Gospodarek\" \r\n<John.Gospodarek@i...> wrote:\r\n> Chris,\r\n> Thanks for the reply.

I kept the chord the same and all the rib sizes\r\nthe same. I spaced the ribs out appropriately for the new span. I used cf \r\niron-on ribbon over the tip from LE to TE as well as a piece around the \r\ntip, and extended the CF spars to the end of the wingtips. All this was done\r\nto aid in discus launching the bug. Wing was covered with Solarfilm Lite.\r\n\r\nI went out to fly at the local ballfield and there is a definately noticeable\r\nincrease in performance. I used the new wing on a standard bug fuselage. \r\nEventually I noticed that there was a small hill on the upwind side of the\r\nfield and started to do a little mini-slope flying there. That with the \r\nlight thermals allowed me to get the bug to over 300 feet several times\r\nand over 400 feet once. Longest flight was over 5 minutes easy, in fact I\r\nhad to dive the bug down because I was afraid I was going to go beyond the\r\nrange of the GWS receiver I had in it!\r\n\r\nAnyways, experiment was very successful!

The pain is trying to work all of the kinks out.\r\n\r\nThe crucial step is to use the Dihedral gauge on the print. This is \r\nthe Keystone for getting everything to quit. That said, a little extra \r\ndihedral will just make for a more \"agile\" airplane. Don't fret if \r\nyou are building another pod. \r\n\r\nWhen cutting your new formers, place them against the bottom \r\nof the wing to check for fit, prior to gluing into place. I'd \r\nrecommend a a light layer of glass (.75oz) to ensure its survival. \r\nthis will also help with your concern of contributing support to the \r\nwing.\r\n\r\nDimensions:\r\n\r\nMy wing panels measure 17.375 inches each (extended wing)\r\nTotal Span assembled is 34.5 inches\r\nLength from TE of wing to LE of full-flying elevator is 10.5 inches\r\nElevator size is roughly 10 x 1.75 inches at widest point\r\nRudder size is 6.5 x 2.625 inches at the widest point.\r\n\r\nThe Vert. fin/rudder design I use is from the SuperGee at \r\nwww.monkeytumble.com - Look in the DLG section under \r\nSuperGee PDF's.

The sub-fin area is relatively \r\nsmall and doesn't catch on landing. Don't forget to harden the \r\nedges of the tail feathers with thin CA for strength.\r\n\r\nHang in there.

I have \r\npulled pegs out on launch before.  I settled on using some wire \r\nthread that loops through a hole in the peg twice and then sticks \r\ninto the spar 4-5\" and is epoxied in.\r\n\r\n> 7.

Joe Wurts saw me \r\nfly and remarked a stiffer tailboom would really help the \r\nperformance.  Rick Walba, who helps run tailbooms.com, suggested an \r\navia micro carbon boom.

I have \r\ntwo cs-10s powering the controls -- I believe these are exactly the \r\nsame as the gws pico servos.

We're picking up a little\r\nmomentum and the ball's really starting to roll.  Still, a long ways to go\r\nto become \"high traffic\", but then we're just here for the fun and\r\nrelaxation right?\r\n\r\n  There is a huge amount of new stuff going on at the website...  messages\r\nthat need answers, new articles, lot of links to great places, banners\r\ngearing up, many downloads (I just added more videos and a bunch of\r\nbuilder's plans)... these are all free for the taking.  Some of the members\r\nhave sent in photos of their airplanes and workshops, which really deserve\r\nyour attention.  And there's a lot more being entered almost as we speak.\r\n\r\n  You guys really need to see Bob Severance's Travelaire.  It's way down the\r\nlist of boards in \"Airplanes- Giant Scale\".  This is truely a beautiful\r\naircraft!  Thanks Bob!\r\n\r\n  I've also added quite a number of boards to the forum.  It doesn't matter\r\nwhat you fly or want to buy/sell, there's a space for it in the forum.  Just\r\nin case I'm wrong about this, give me your input and we can add more boards.\r\n\r\n  With all the initial uploading of files, I had almost run out of alloted\r\nserver space, so I expanded this by 5 times.  That will be enough to hold\r\nfor quite a while, and I don't have any problem alloting more space if we\r\nneed it.  (It's all sponsored by a great company. <g>)\r\n\r\n  I could really use some help from you guys in one particular area though.\r\nAs you travel around the internet and the neighborhood, please mention\r\nRCLanding.com to everyone.  Print the URL everywhere.  This is always the\r\nbest advertising... word of mouth.\r\n\r\n  I don't ever want to charge the members/users of this site any fees.  It\r\njust seems like we should have a place that's free.  I've never wanted to\r\npay for any of it.  The way to do that is through the masses.  If we get\r\nenough people using the site, businesses will come to us to advertise their\r\nbanners and companies.  I promise this won't turn into a cluttered\r\nadvertising madhouse.  Ads will be kept in one place, so you can choose to\r\ngo there or not.\r\n  I intend to keep the cost to those companies very low, so as to just pay\r\nexpenses here, which should also be an incentive to them.  In return, we get\r\na full fledged website that's very active and very capable of servicing our\r\nneeds - for free!  I believe it will work.\r\n  I believe the only reason these huge forums charge members is purely due\r\nto greed.  They are all being bought up by each other, and they are all\r\ngoing to the \"charge for everything\" theme.  I believe it can be different.\r\nI sure could use your help.\r\n  End of political soapbox.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n  We need your ideas.  The forum is ready to hear those ideas.  So if you\r\nget a few minutes between flight sessions this weekend, take a look at the\r\nsite and let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nand have a great weekend!\r\nMark\r\nwww.RCLanding.com","authorName":"Mark","date":"September 5, 2003 4:17 PM"},{"id":288,"subject":"Great Weekend and Thank You!","body":"Hi All,\r\n\r\n  First off, I know I should not clog up the various groups with off topic\r\nemails.

A couple\r\nguys at the flying club were insisting I get down there more often, so\r\nthat's planned for next weekend.  The weather has gotten better here in the\r\nOhio Valley... which has been rare this year.  We've gotten a lot of rain up\r\nuntil now.\r\n\r\n  It's the work week again, and I really should get back to work, and it's a\r\nlot easier after a great weekend.\r\n\r\n  I just wanted to say thanks to all the members at the group and at the\r\nwebsite. There are lots of new people, to welcome,  ....so Welcome!  I think\r\nthe member count at the group is up to about 60 and at the website we gained\r\nover 30 people in just a couple days.  I know this isn't revolutionary, but\r\nvirtually everything is breaking new ground for RCL.\r\n\r\n  There are about 5 different companies with new business or new products\r\nthat want to do a little expose' for the website.  It will take a short\r\nwhile to put these together, but you can look forward to that.  Bill\r\nOberdeick has sent me a list of items he has for sale.  He also gave me\r\npermission to post these on the website, so I will get this stuff in the\r\nforum classifieds as soon as I get the next pot of coffee made.\r\n\r\n  I sure hope all of you had an equally great weekend.  I saw a number of\r\nyour names in various places on the site.  Thanks for the reviews, input,\r\nforum messages, pictures, and anything else I'm not remembering.\r\n\r\n  The thing with the website is this:  The more active it becomes, the more\r\nleverage we have to invite some of the really big, professional, RC entities\r\nto come in and show us their stuff.  I'm not doing this to commercialize the\r\nplace, but rather to simply make it a high quality stop along our \"internet\r\nsurfing\" way.  I think it would be fun and educational to see the latest and\r\ngreatest from this industry right here in our own backyard.  ...and if I'm\r\nright about all of that, it's shouldn't cost us one thin dime.  If I'm\r\nwrong, that won't cost us one thin dime either.  So activity from all is a\r\ngood thing!  Join if you haven't.. it's free!  Post in the forum.. it's\r\nfree!  Post your pictures of models and workshops.   Let's give'em a reason\r\nto show us a big selection of new toys!  The numbers are growing.  Stop by!\r\n\r\n  Now,  ..planning this Saturday's trip to the field...  I want to make it\r\neasy...   The spacewalker or the electric glider?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for all your help people!

The week before my flight, the high temperatures were in \r\nthe low 50's and upper 40's which lowered the ground surface \r\ntemperatures.  On the day of my long flight, the temperature was in \r\nthe lower 60's. It was an unusually warm day. The wind was light and \r\nvariable.  Perfect conditions for long thermal flights.\r\n\r\n  In the fall, the best flights sometimes occur when a colder than \r\nnormal night is followed by a hot calm day.  The differential heating \r\n(different surface areas absorbing the sun's heat at different rates) \r\nis increased when the temperature differential is largest between \r\nnight and day or between the ground temperature and the air \r\ntemperature. The flight occurred on the last day of fall (at least \r\nhere) no matter what the calendar said. \r\nThermals do occur during the winter.  It's been my experience that \r\nmost thermal days during the winter, are also windy days.  But there \r\nare exceptions, especially if the winter is dry.  \r\nI'm planning to spend the winter building a superlight bug for next \r\nspring like jason's (Zhack?).

It \r\nshowed the original SAL method.  The first step was standing with \r\nyour arm at your side, holding the glider by the wingtip.  You raise \r\nyour arm towards your back until it's almost vertical and then bring \r\nthe glider back down and continue the arc until you release the \r\nglider when it's facing upward.  The path of the glider is mostly in \r\na vertical plane.  Viewed from the side, the glider makes a  U shaped \r\npath through the air.  During this launch the wings do not develop \r\nlift and so there is no need for a rudder preset to counteract yaw.\r\n\r\nThe method I use (half-discus SAL launch):  Holding the glider by the \r\nwingtip, you twist your body (and the glider) backwards.  You then \r\nunwind your body with your arm trailing behind and then use your arm \r\nfor a final power sweep to release.  The path of the glider is mostly \r\nin a horizontal plane.  From above, the glider would appear to make a \r\npartial circle (about 120 degrees).  This is actually the last part \r\nof a discus launch without the footsteps.  During this launch the \r\nwings do develop lift, so there is a probability that there would be \r\nuneven lift developed by the right and left sides of the wing with a \r\nresulting possible need for a rudder preset.\r\n\r\nThe original method is limited by the span of the glider and the \r\nheight of pilot. Most people who use this method actually raise the \r\nangle of the arm  at the bottom of the U-path, so that the outer \r\nwingtip clears the ground.  Using this modified method, the wing may \r\nor may not produce enough lift to require a rudder preset.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your X-tail is well designed and the boom is rigid enough and long \r\nenough, the X-tail will counteract the yaw force and reduce or \r\neliminate the need for a rudder preset.\r\n\r\nI guess you might wonder why I use the half discus method of SAL \r\nsince it has a greater need for a rudder preset.  \r\nFirst, I also discus launch 1.5 meter dlg's.  Which means that the \r\nsame muscles that are used for the half-discus SAL method are also \r\nused in the full discus launch method.  Physical strength that is \r\ndeveloped in the half discus launch, helps launch height for both \r\nhalf and full discus methods. \r\nSecond, I believe that you can develop more speed in the launch. The \r\noriginal SAL method uses mostly only arm and shoulder strength with \r\nan assist from gravity during the initail downward part of the \r\nlaunch.  The half-discus SAL launch uses your waist, torso, shoulder \r\nand arm muscles.\r\n\r\nJohn","authorName":"John","date":"January 13, 2004 11:06 PM"},{"id":328,"subject":"Complete Composite Airplane Foam Cutting/Bagging Setup For Sale","body":"\r\n\r\nThis setup is in like new condition.

While this is UNQUESTIONABLY the way to maximize \r\ndead air time in a 60\" competion class DLG contest, I don't think \r\nthis style of building or flying makes maximum use of the BUG's most \r\ndesirable qualities which are its LIGHT WEIGHT (if built \"correclty\")\r\nand RADICAL manouverablilty (again if built \"correctly\").  \r\n\r\nI concede that a 60\" DLG launched to 100 feet is going to outfly a \r\n60\" DLG launched to 40 feet, But I contend that a 2.5 oz BUG launched \r\nto 20 feet will outfly a 3.5 to 4oz BUG launched to 60 feet (which I \r\ncan't see anybody launching a BUG to without blowing it apart).  So, \r\nI prefer to leave the v-tail for maximum tail lightness and to allow \r\nthe use of a light (4g) Kokam 145mAh cell for juice.  Most \r\nimportantly, the use of the v tail and a gentle javelin or side-arm \r\n(NOT DLG) launch allows the use of smaller dimeter (LIGHTER)tailbooms \r\nwhich is where the MAJOR weight savings is to be had.  I've already \r\nposted on this in the past and stirred the pot a bit.  Many others \r\ncontend that the 1/8\" CF tube I favor is too sloppy--maybe if your \r\ntrying to full force discus launch.  Anyway, you can look up details \r\nof this discussion in previous posts. \r\n\r\nSo, the fun of the BUG is in my opinion building lite and \r\nmanouverable and having fun down to 10 and 20 feet altitude where \r\nthermals form tight and fast.  I suspect that not even a top of the \r\nline 60\" DLG can work the bubbles this gem can at 10 feet off the \r\ndeck. \r\n\r\nSo, the major departurs in the way I build my BUGS are:\r\n\r\n1.  Contest wood only.\r\n2.  Use of Modelairtech Clearfilm for covering and WBPU on bare \r\nwood.  No Color.\r\n3.  Use of CST's 1/8\" cf for tailbooms\r\n4.  single cell Kokam 145 cell from www.b-p-p.com\r\n5.  positioning all gear forward of foremost bulkhead for balance.\r\n6.  GWS pico rx and pico BB servos\r\n7.  extended wing as described in other posts\r\n8.  Vtail (NO DLG style tails-- I built one and the lightest i could \r\ndo is 6g compared to the 2g vtail.  That 4g diff takes about 12-15g \r\nmore weight in the nose to balance.\r\n9.  don't cover any part of the fuselage with f/glass.  It's too \r\nheavy.  Try this--  3M-77 forward of the wing LE, then apply 3M \r\ntartan crystal clear packing tape (1mil thick).  Then iron down.  \r\nVERY Strong and on ly adds 1g. Cover the nose forward to the EPP \r\nblock (see below), then coat with goop.\r\n\r\nA point of interest is that in order to get her to balance with the \r\nsingle Kokam 145 cell, I had to put the Rx, batery and both GWS pico \r\nBB servos forward of the foremost bulkhead. That leaves the entire \r\ncompartment under the wing empty (except of course for the pushrods). \r\nAs this compartment is right under the CG it'll make a perfect \r\nballast box should I wish to fly at the more usual wingloads of 3-4 \r\noz/sq. ft. \r\n\r\nAnother GREAT innovation has been the replacement of the nose balsa \r\nblock with EPP foam sanded to shape, spackled and coated with marine \r\nGOOP thinned with toluene.  VERY smooth and resilient.  This cushions \r\nMAJOR landing impact and never chips and dents like the balsa block \r\ndoes.  Try it-- you'll never go back.  I'll post photos later.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I'm going to have fun seeing what a tip-\r\nlaunchable, extremely nimble glider can do at under 2oz/sq/ft.\r\n\r\nShould be lots of fun","authorName":"jason_wasylyk","date":"March 14, 2004 8:42 PM"},{"id":357,"subject":"Re: I thought I was a member of the group","body":"Before building a DLG style bug, consider an ultralight version.

I've done this hundreds of times \r\nwithout any breakage.  A shoulder injury prevents javelin launching \r\nso SAL is necessary for me.\r\n  \r\nWhen I built my bug, I didn't order the contest grade balsa but I \r\nused the lightest balsa I had (about 7-8), and a lightweight wrapped \r\ntail boom.  This boom weighs about the same as the 1/8\" pultruded CF \r\ntube but is stiffer and larger in diamater.  The boom diameter is \r\nlarge enough that you can put holes in the boom to allow the pushrods \r\nto exit the boom in front of the tail, making pushrod hookup easy.\r\nThe link for this boom is posted in the Links section (replacement \r\nfor Skyshark 2P).  \r\nI did fiberglass the fuse for strength adding more weight.\r\nAll radio components are forward of the wing LE.  \r\nI used Hitec HS-50 servos because they are lighter than the Pico BB's.\r\nThe weight of my x-tail pieces are not near as light as your v-tail.\r\nThe original flying weight of my bug was about 3.8 ounces but it is \r\nstrong enough for 70 foot launches. \r\n\r\nLight with incredible thermalling ability but doesn't launch high \r\nVS heavier with decent thermalling ability but launches high.  Two \r\nschools of thought with positive points for both.\r\nFor me, the answer is somewhere between your 2.6 ounces and my 3.8 \r\nounces, but with the strength to launch high.  I'd be satisfied with \r\n3.25 ounces and the ability to SAL launch to about 60 feet. \r\n\r\nThe weight of my x-tail pieces for coming Bug #2 is 6.7 grams with CF \r\nreinforcement and fiberglassed fin/rudder. \r\nAlready have the 250 mah lipoly (Etech) 5.5 grams.\r\nMore to come but another project first.\r\n\r\nJohn Gallagher\r\n\r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"jason_wasylyk\" <thetoothdoc@s...> \r\nwrote:\r\n> --- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"John\" <gldrgidr@m...> wrote:\r\n> > Jason,\r\n> > That's incredible!!

I've done this hundreds of times \r\n  without any breakage.  A shoulder injury prevents javelin launching \r\n  so SAL is necessary for me.\r\n    \r\n  When I built my bug, I didn't order the contest grade balsa but I \r\n  used the lightest balsa I had (about 7-8), and a lightweight wrapped \r\n  tail boom.  This boom weighs about the same as the 1/8\" pultruded CF \r\n  tube but is stiffer and larger in diamater.  The boom diameter is \r\n  large enough that you can put holes in the boom to allow the pushrods \r\n  to exit the boom in front of the tail, making pushrod hookup easy.\r\n  The link for this boom is posted in the Links section (replacement \r\n  for Skyshark 2P).  \r\n  I did fiberglass the fuse for strength adding more weight.\r\n  All radio components are forward of the wing LE.  \r\n  I used Hitec HS-50 servos because they are lighter than the Pico BB's.\r\n  The weight of my x-tail pieces are not near as light as your v-tail.\r\n  The original flying weight of my bug was about 3.8 ounces but it is \r\n  strong enough for 70 foot launches. \r\n\r\n  Light with incredible thermalling ability but doesn't launch high \r\n  VS heavier with decent thermalling ability but launches high.  Two \r\n  schools of thought with positive points for both.\r\n  For me, the answer is somewhere between your 2.6 ounces and my 3.8 \r\n  ounces, but with the strength to launch high.  I'd be satisfied with \r\n  3.25 ounces and the ability to SAL launch to about 60 feet. \r\n\r\n  The weight of my x-tail pieces for coming Bug #2 is 6.7 grams with CF \r\n  reinforcement and fiberglassed fin/rudder. \r\n  Already have the 250 mah lipoly (Etech) 5.5 grams.\r\n  More to come but another project first.\r\n\r\n  John Gallagher\r\n\r\n\r\n  --- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"jason_wasylyk\" <thetoothdoc@s...> \r\n  wrote:\r\n  > --- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"John\" <gldrgidr@m...> wrote:\r\n  > > Jason,\r\n  > > That's incredible!!

I\r\nused a 1/8 carbon rod and I know several other who have too.  Also I used\r\n1/16 inch balsa fort the tips instead of 1/8 inch.  I also plan on using\r\n1/32 balsa with a thin layer of apoxy for the tail.  This may be too thin\r\nand break so I will probably actually add some .5oz glass to one side only.\r\nI have weighed everything that is built minus the one wing half with radio\r\nequipment and will be under 4 oz.  I don't know how John G built his 35 in\r\nbug so light.\r\n> >\r\n> > Clark\r\n> >   ----- Original Message ----- \r\n> >   From: Jim H.\r\n> >   To: BugHLG yahoogroups.com ; jason_wasylyk\r\n> >   Sent: Friday, March 26, 2004 2:58 PM\r\n> >   Subject: Re: [BugHLG] Re: 1.8 oz/ft2 BUG\r\n> >\r\n> >\r\n> >   jason_wasylyk on 3-14-04 7:42 PM wrote:\r\n> >\r\n> >   > 2.

We are encouraging everyone to bring their vintage scale, modern scale, power slope scale (PSS) and any others for fun flying.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of Soar Utah is on flying and having fun. There is a wide range of activities that other family members can enjoy while you are at the slope.\r\n\r\nDay 1, Sept. 3 (Friday)\r\n\r\nButterfield Canyon is situated on the mountain peak above the Kennecott Copper mine which provides an outstanding panoramic view of the mine as well as views of the surrounding countryside. This is a 360-degree flying site for both slope and thermal flying.\r\n\r\nThe terraced pit is a half-mile deep, about two and one-half miles wide, and the working area covers 1,900 acres; the mine's open pit is one of only a few man-made objects that can be seen from space and the second largest man-made excavation in the world! Elevation of the peak is 8,800 feet.\r\n\r\nDay 2 & 3, Sept. 4 & 5 (Saturday & Sunday)\r\n\r\nPoint of the Mountain is where hang gliders as well as R/C pilots come from around the world to experience the smooth air, predictable weather and consistent ridge soaring conditions. The morning wind normally blows from the south, so most of our contest activities will be on the south side. In the afternoon, the winds normally switch and blow from the north, and we fly on the north launch. Both sights offer drive up convenience (no hiking the hill for each flight).\r\n\r\nDay 4, Sept. 6 (Monday)\r\n\r\nFrancis Peak is located directly east of the Kaysville I-15 exit, and is a popular flying destination for every Soar Utah. The rewards are not only the bird's-eye panoramic view of the Great Salt Lake and Morgan County but with an elevation of 9,600 feet it allows for many types of flying.\r\n\r\nThe Awards Banquet will be held on Saturday evening where the winners of Soar Utah will be awarded their trophies. We will have a static display with peoples choice awards for the best planes and we will hold one of the best raffles in the West. Previous raffles have included nearly $5,000 in soaring merchandise!\r\n\r\nPre-registration for Soar Utah 2004 is encouraged. Soar Utah is an AMA event and proof of current AMA membership will be required. There is no charge to watch. Food and drinks will be available at the Point on both Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nFor complete information on the Soar Utah 2004, local hotels, maps, schedule of events, and other information please visit our web site at: http://www.silentflyer.org If you have any questions, please give me a call at (801) 453-0611 (evening), or e-mail me at imsf-sec@...\r\n\r\nThank you and we hope to see you in September!!\r\n\r\nErik Vogel, Registrar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n---------------------------------\r\nDo you Yahoo!?\r\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

Today I looked at the plan again and suddenly I realised \r\nsomething that I have missed before! The airfoil is not flat \r\nbottomed! If one draws a line perpendicular to the TE of the rib it \r\nwill intersect at the bottom of the LE notch rather than along the \r\nbottom of the airfoil! It may have been obvious to you all but I have \r\nalways assumed that the airfoil is flat bottomed and thus make and \r\nmount the wing as such. By doing this I am sure I have given the wing \r\na huge positive incidence and I have the feeling that this is one of \r\nthe contributing factors why my previous bugs never few well.\r\n\r\nThe other problem I have is the wing never sit securely on the \r\nfuselage but rather rocking with the wingtips seesawing.\r\n\r\nNow looking at building my 4th attempt - Apart from building the wing \r\nas a semisymmetrical one as what the airfoil would suggest I have \r\nalso decided to change the fuselage to one that is used in apogee hlg \r\ndesigned by mark drela. Certainly I will use 2 locating dowels at the \r\nLE of the wing to eliminate the rocking problem. This fuselage will \r\nalso have a thinner profile and straigher pushrod runs which I am \r\nsure will help.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone has good way to produce the wing the way it is intended \r\nto be?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nHenry","authorName":"dimple_kwok","date":"August 10, 2004 9:02 PM"},{"id":441,"subject":"Who sells carbon bug","body":"Can some one tell me who sells the carbon bug kit that the previous poster talks about? \r\nHow much is it?

I'm still struggling to thermal with the plane \r\nbecause it's so small and flys through thermals too quickly for me.\r\n\r\nInstead of Carbon tubes, I used wooden dowels for the spars and the \r\nboom; they were a little flexable, but worked well enough.  Routing \r\nthe pushrods outside of the fuse is not very difficult using small \r\naluminum tube guides.\r\n\r\nPushrods are getting more solid with .025\" wires and tail surfaces \r\nextended further towards the bottom of the 'V' to use less bend in \r\nthe rods to get up to the horns.  Still a fair amount of play...\r\n\r\nLess dihedral is NO fun.  5\" dihedral doesn't cut it for me.  I'm \r\naround 5.5\" and handling is much quicker and allows easier rolling \r\ninto turns.  However, with 5\" dihedral, I can hold inverted for 15 or \r\nso seconds (awesome when you're 5 feet off the deck).  \r\n\r\nLately, we've been playing with ailerons and an extra wing servo.  \r\nIt's too heavy and not responsive enough, but my friend did an \r\nawesome vertical roll into the ground from 30 feet.\r\n\r\nAnyone else had problems blowing off tail feathers on launch from tip-\r\nlaunching?  My count is three times so far.  \r\n\r\nDan E.\r\nDanStrider@...","authorName":"flydanstrider","date":"May 30, 2002 9:01 PM"},{"id":521,"subject":"Bug Experiences Update","body":"Wow- now it's almost a year later... You wanted to hear how this \r\nnext project went.\r\n\r\nHere goes:\r\nI finished \"Bug 2\" by Summer 2005.  Final weight was 83.3 g.  Wing \r\nalone was 31.9 g.  This was achieved using contest grade balsa (and \r\nweighed each sheet to find the lightest!), some of the \r\nlightening \"tips\", and a lighter type of covering.  Also used \r\nthinner CF rods this time.\r\n\r\n{My first Bug (shelved - no electronics righ now) weighed about 101 \r\ng at first and now 103 g with repairs.  The wing alone weighs 40.3 \r\ng.}\r\n\r\nOn Bug 2 the wing is somewhat more fragile than the first, but still \r\nplenty strong.  The fuse, though, is very fragile because I used \r\ncontest grade balsa and I have \"detonated\" it many times in \r\ncrashes.  But, I just pick up all the pieces and CA them carefully \r\nback together.  This works fine even in the most devastating-looking \r\ncrashes.  It actually gets stronger each time, and not much heavier. \r\n(recently at 85.8 g after 5-6 repairs)  These \"crashes\" are not \r\nexactly crashes, just generally stalls and nose-ins from 2'-3' \r\naltitude.  It's that fragile.\r\n\r\nBut...Bug 2 really flies great.  It floats nicely, but still loves \r\nto fly fast.  On launch, the small tail CF (I think 1/8\") tube does \r\nflex a bit, so I'm sure I lose altitude, but it still goes way up.  \r\nBest thermal flight around 2 minutes.  Pretty good from my 1/4 acre \r\nhouse lot.  I do use some of the neighbor's air space! :)  That's \r\nwhat's great about this - it flies in very small areas - but you can \r\nstill point the nose down a little and it will really cover a lot of \r\ndistance in a hurry.\r\n\r\nI still am running the V-tail, no launch peg, and a launch preset \r\nswitch on my TX with some \"up\" and some rudder on it. The CF wing \r\nrods are run to the wing tip-that's what I hang onto when I whip it \r\nup there.\r\n\r\nNext I plan to try the Lipo cells.  I built an extended nose on this \r\none so that I have some CG adjustment room for the lighter battery.  \r\nI have also switched servos.  The Bluebird BM306's I had in there\r\n(6.6 g each with no horn) have failed now after many flights.  I \r\nthink the launch stresses are hard on them.  (Brought it down on the \r\nlast flight with only one servo working! - Yikes.. but no crash)  I \r\nam trying the Draganfly $9.99 micro servos (6.8 g each with no \r\nhorn).  Cheap, but I don't think these will last all that long.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any servo recommendations?  I am sure HS55 are \r\ngreat but they weigh 7.6 g each.\r\n\r\n\r\n3/16/04--- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, \"abra32001\" <esojala@a...> \r\nwrote:\r\n>\r\n> I wanted to relay some of my experiences with this great model:\r\n> I have switched to a 4-cell 50 mah battery and now have the weight \r\nat \r\n> 101 g, or 3.5 oz.

It required nearly 3/4 \r\ndown elevator to maintain forward flight, but what is amazing that a \r\n3.5 oz airplane could be flown in that much wind at all.  That was \r\nwith the original balsa fuse, and no gyro.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the articles about using a gyro for discus launch \r\nrecovery, I had to try it. So I purchased a small Century gyro. \r\nReally amazing!!! You can throw it hard and it takes off like a \r\nrocket. All you have to do is to level off at the top. Good launch \r\nnearly every time.  The way I extended the spar throught the wing tip \r\ncould better be done by extending the actual spar to the tip, which \r\nwould be stronger.  I added the wire after the wing was built and you \r\ncan see in the pictures how the wing tip is getting beat-up from any \r\ntwisting that occurs on the launch peg.\r\n\r\nMy lightest version was 3.5 oz. The latest version with CF fuselage \r\nand gyro is 3.8 oz. \r\n\r\nMost of my flights are under one minute: 30-50 seconds are very \r\ncommon.  Occasionally, I will get a small thermal and can increase \r\nflight times to a couple minutes.  At 3.8 oz it is a bit heavy.  I've \r\nbeen wanting to add about 6 inches to the center section, thereby \r\nincreasing the span.  I really like the gyro assisted launches and \r\nthink it difficult to build much lighter while still maintaining \r\ndurability.  The original balsa fuse is lighter, but it can take very \r\nlittle abuse and after repeated repairs, it's not so light anymore.\r\n\r\nI've very new at HLG, so my short flight times could also be improved \r\nwith experience and savy reading thermal conditions.  I can tell when \r\nI'm trying to fly \"correctly\" verses being overly active at the \r\ncontrols.  The only thing that is a bit peculiar about the design is \r\nthat with this airfoil, it hold its pitch heading and does not \r\ncorrect itself from a moderate dive.  That's great for penetration \r\nand flying in a strong breeze, but for still air thermal work, I \r\nthink a flatter bottom or slight undercambered airfoil would be \r\nbetter.  But... remember what I said... I'm not very experienced with \r\ngliders!\r\n\r\nRegardless of my experience level and inablility to sustain longer \r\nflights, this little airplane is one of my favorites and I take the \r\nopportunity to fly it often.  I'd really like to hear what \r\nperformance others have been getting.\r\n\r\nRgds,\r\n--Colin--\r\n\r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@y..., John Gallagher <gldrgidr@b...> wrote:\r\n> Thanks Colin for the photos.

To make it interesting, the format differs slightly from what you may be used to.\r\n   \r\n  What is the format?\r\n   \r\n    There are 3 classes: expert, sportsman and novice.

You then submit your 5 flight times and 5 landing scores on-line.\r\n   \r\n     In order to determine a winner, your scores for each flight will be compared against a blind pilot.  The pilot whose flight times and landings are the closest to the blind pilot will be deemed the winner.

The contest will be \r\nheld between August 31st and September 3rd and scores are submitted \r\non-line.  To make it interesting, the format differs slightly from \r\nwhat you may be used to.\r\n\r\nWhat is the format?\r\n\r\n  There are 3 classes: expert, sportsman and novice.  Any class of \r\nplane may be used as long as it thermals and does not have a motor.  \r\n\r\n  Unlike traditional thermal contests, this Blind Thermal contest is \r\ndone in reverse.  Before you begin you will get a point total to \r\nshoot for.  You will then have 5 flights and 5 landing scores that \r\nshould add up to your point target.  (Or as close as possible.)

I'm sure all the interest in small electrics (such as I've \r\nbeen building recently) can't hurt.  I've built my fair share of foamies \r\nand a tail-dragging 40\" scaled down Bridi Kaos that I call Urban Kaos.  \r\nAll up weight is right around 19oz with a double taper wing.  I was \r\nplaying with retracts after a hard landing bent a landing gear wire but \r\nI think I'm going to abandon that, they're just too flimsy.  I've got a \r\npair of the main gear from the Parkzone T-28 that I'll use on the next \r\nwing I build.  I think I'll use barn door ailerons and split flaps \r\ninstead of strip flaperons.  While they do work, they don't work as well \r\nas I'd like.  A thinner but longer, higher aspect wing will probably \r\nwork well also.  I've always liked the profile of the Kaos though.  I \r\ndigress.\r\n\r\nSeveral months I also got out my Gentle Lady kit that's been sitting in \r\nvarious closets for the better part of two decades. I built it over the \r\nwinter and now I'm finally starting to cover it.  I still need to get a \r\nfull range receiver for it, I don't trust a park flyer receiver with a \r\n2M bird.  At least standard size servos are cheaper than micros, go \r\nfigure.  I got a pair of standard size Hitec HS-332HDs for $11 each for \r\nthe Lady and a pair of HS-55s for which ever HLG gets finished first.  \r\nI'll use a park flyer receiver for that one.  I've seen somewhere that \r\none pilot was using a couple of photo batteries in serial as a flight \r\npack but I can't seem to find that now. Has anyone else heard of that?  \r\nSeems to me this would be a fairly small pack and while not rechargable, \r\nrelatively inexpensive and long lasting given the low demands of a \r\nsailplane.","authorName":"Tim Schuh","date":"April 8, 2010 12:48 AM"},{"id":65,"subject":"RE: [BugHLG] Carbon Bug","body":"I can not help you on the Carbon Bug.

It was designed as a quick to build alternative with input from \r\nFrans Bal (MiMi), Dr. Mark Drela (Apogee and about a million others) and \r\nmany, many other folks.  It's about half way between the solid wing of \r\nthe MiMi and a fully built up wing and honestly about the most fun I've \r\nhad building a wing.  It uses solid balsa for about the first 30%, \r\nstandard TE stock and a geodetic set of ribs that can be rough cut and \r\nsanded to shape in no time flat.  Very fast to build that wing.  With \r\nnon-lightweight hobby shop balsa and standard Econocoat my wing weighed \r\nin a 120g and I massively overbuilt it.  I fiberglassed all the dihedral \r\nbreaks even though it's not called for in the plans nor really necessary \r\naccording to the designer.","authorName":"Tim Schuh","date":"October 3, 2010 4:42 PM"},{"id":692,"subject":"Re: [BugHLG] GWS Receiver Wireing Diagram","body":"As long as your transmitter can handle v-tail mixing, why not just dump the \r\ny-adapter.

I doubt you will have the strength \r\nfor SAL.\r\n3. A built up tail would I feel be weaker and heavier than the \r\n1/16th balsa. and will not take any hard landings if you use the + \r\ntail. as a lighter V tail what about trying 2mm Depron?\r\n4. The spar Idea will not work unless it was bent to follow the high \r\npoint of each rib. For a lighter spar you could go for a carbon free \r\nflight wing/tail spar of say 5mm these are real light. Check out \r\nFree Flight Supplies website \r\nhttp://www.freeflightsupplies.co.uk/\r\n5. I feel that only by making a Kevlar pod would you be able to get \r\na fuz that is not expendable. I can not see the point of using \r\nlighter wood then making it heavy again with glass cloth etc. Why \r\nnot use light thicker wood in the fist place that does not need the \r\ncloth?\r\n\r\nSorry to sound so negative IT'S only my opinion. Go ahead and try \r\nyour mod's and let us all know how you get on. The best way to \r\nreduce the wing loadong would be to 1. increase the wing area 2. try \r\nto get one of the new rx's that use 2 nicad cells for power 3. go \r\nover to 1 lion cell.

No point in making all these savings then adding lead to \r\nthe nose. \r\n\r\nGood luck\r\nSteve Wheeler\r\n--- In BugHLG@y..., \"bob_chiang2\" <rhc3@c...> wrote:\r\n> Hi all,\r\n> \r\n> I've finally ordered a bunch of carbon tubes and have begun \r\n> construction of a Bug.

The big difference foam is that you need a building board.  That can be a piece of \"Celotex\" ceiling tile or similar, but it is better to secure the Celotex to a very flat piece of wood/plywood with tape.  At least a 6\"x24\" surface is needed and 1'x2' would be better.  You will need pins (preferably \"T\" pins) and pin clamps.  You need a utility knife and single edge razor blades, but an Exacto knife and #11 blades would be a big help.  You will need various sanding materials, which you probably already have.  A saw to cut the CF boom is needed.  It can be a very fine tooth hacksaw blade if you first wrap the CF with masking tape.  (CA the cut surface to avoid splinters.)  Use the saw blade free, not in the frame.  Do not apply much pressure to the saw.  You will need a set of twist drills, say 1/16\" to 1/4\" by 64ths, or a comparable metric set.  You will need rubber bands to apply clamping force but a set of clamps would be a big help.  Cloths pins can be use in some cases.

Anyways, I like the open look when used with a \r\ntransparent covering.\r\n\r\n2)  I've been thinking about how to extend the spar and tie it into a \r\nthumb and finger pad so the grip transfers directly to the spar.  \r\nMaybe I could balance the wing tip grip with the radio antenna on the \r\nother side.\r\n\r\n3)  I think you're right and will use sheet for the tails.  The Little \r\nNipper even uses 3/32\".\r\n\r\n4)  I hadn't thought about needing a curved spar to follow the high \r\npoint.  I once made a wing with tapered tips and cracked rib \r\nconstruction, so it just needed an angle point in the spar to follow \r\nthe high point of the ribs.\r\n\r\n5)  I'm relatively new to using glass and carbon in models, so I don't \r\nknow the comparative weights/strengths of using thicker balsa vs. \r\ncomposite reinforcement.  As long as I was putting in the order for \r\ncarbon tubes, I thought I'd buy some glass cloth and carbon matt to \r\nplay with.\r\n\r\nI read some previous comment that the cruciform tail might be reduced \r\nin size, so I'll probably try that to reduce weight.  Or, I may try a \r\nT-tail like the Little Nipper which seems to have a very small \r\nhorizontal stab, I guess because it's full flying?\r\n\r\nAnd Steve, I don't take your comments as negative, just welcome \r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n-Bob Chiang\r\n\r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@y..., \"no1steve2002\" <stevew@h...> wrote:\r\n> Bob\r\n> A few points I would like to pick up on.\r\n> 1.

I think the Bug is one of the easiest gliders to build. It has fewer parts and the parts are smaller then most gliders. The plans are straight forward and easy to read.

Having bought the 1/8th dowell for the leading edges, by post, there is no good \"builders\" model shop in the vicinity, it was obviously pretty poor stuff, weak and kinked because the grain of the wood it was made from went in all directions.  I have some bamboo barbeque skewers for use on vintage planes but these are only 9 or12 inches long. However I discover that these can easily be spliced together to make longer lengths.  It is easier with more than two lengths to join, I had two for each wing on three planes i.e. twelve lengths to make six l/e. ( I had got two lengths of suitable dowell for the fourth, or first, Bug.) You need skewers of similar diameter for this to work well. I taped the skewers together side by side into a flat formation and chiselled one end to make a one-sided taper, this needs to be about an inch long or a little more.  The taper can be then dressed to a nice smooth, FLAT surface with a  file or similar. \r\n When you separate the skewers and reverse each pair the tapers will mate together to make a seamless join. I rolled a short length of masking tape round each join to hold it steady and dribbled some cyano into it. Fantastic! I now had six long lengths of superior strong and bendy wood. I thought this might add a lot of weight but even though I did not choose the Contest-grade wood specified the planes are coming out at a tiny bit over the three and a half ounces shown on the plan.\r\n> \r\n> I had a lot of bother getting the servos linked to the control surfaces but overcame this by having a separate length of push-rod wire connected to the servos another to the rudder or elevator and soldering the joins in short lengths of brass tube in the cavity underneath the wing.  \r\n> \r\n> I sourced 120 mAh batteries at a very good price and these weigh just 15gm with leads. Servos are 5gm Tower Pro. Covering is Solarfilm Solite.\r\n> \r\n> First side arm launches were interesting, I had not done this before but I am now getting the hang of it.

The\r\nbug was designed around the Hitec HS-50 servos, 555 receiver and a 3x50ma\r\nnicad battery. That is (was) about 1.7oz (48g) in radio gear. Therefore, the\r\nfuse had to be built short, and as light as possible to properly balance the\r\nplane without adding tail weight... You do build your tail feathers as light\r\nas possible, right? My current micro system of choice is a Castle Creations\r\nBerg 4L receiver, Dymond D47 servos and a 2x120 mah LiPo battery. This gives\r\nan all up radio weight of 0.85 oz (24g). This is the only (good) 72mHz\r\ncombination that I know of that will run on 2 LiPos without a regulator.\r\nMany of the 2.4 gHz receivers will also run on 2 LiPos without a regulator,\r\nbut you still want the Dymond servos. Most servos will go to sleep on more\r\nthan 6 volts, and never wake up... As a side benefit, this also allows for a\r\nstouter fuse. Better added strength in the nose, than added lead to balance.\r\nYou also might (should) lengthen the nose a bit to help with the balance\r\nwith this light of a radio. Maybe as much as an inch (or more) if you keep\r\nyou tail light. Did I mention that you should build your tail feathers\r\nlight? Like 4-5 pound wood, sealed with 1-2 coats of clear Varathane that is\r\nwiped on with a rag, and *immediately* wiped off.\r\n\r\nCheck eFlight for 7.4v 120mah 2S LiPos and charger. They use them in their\r\nsmall RC planes.\r\n\r\nWith this radio, a 3oz Bug is easily obtainable. Just keep your tail light,\r\nand don't waist all the weight savings with lead. My current Bug project is\r\nrocket launched and weighs under 90g with a spent rocket motor casing (10g\r\nfor the motor casing) on board.... I have mentioned this Bug before. It's\r\nalmost finished. It keeps getting preempted by other projects. I will post\r\npix when it is flying.\r\n\r\nAnd a  thinner airfoil is probably a good idea at these reduced weights.\r\nEven though it won't reproduce true, AG35 blended to AG36 might be a good\r\nplace to start.\r\n\r\nFWIW, my first Bug was 102g. Built with 5-6 pound balsa, Ultracote Lite (NO\r\nMonokote, way heavy), 2 x GWS Pico servos, GWS pico receiver and 4 x 110\r\nNiCad (it's what I had on hand), and NO lead needed to balance. Flys very\r\nnice, but a lead sled by today's standards.\r\n\r\nLee\r\n\r\n*Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in\r\nthe universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.*\r\n-*Bill Watterson*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sat, Aug 13, 2011 at 2:38 PM, gldrgidr <gldrgidr@...> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Matt,\r\n> I think you are just bragging about how light your bug is.

I had tried cutting round handy tin lids etc but these did not leave the holes very tidy. I the end I turned up a cone from a scrap of wood about 4 ½ inches long tapering from say ¼ inch up to 1 ¼ inches and glued some 120 grade abrasive paper to it.  Just a few turns in in a rough and ready hole and Bingo! a really neat clean finish, and round too. I should patent it and become a millionaire -  why has no one thought of this before, or have I reinvented the wheel?\r\n> \r\n> I used Sellotape Diamond tape for the hinges.  This is very thick isn't it.  I cut it to half width, ¼ inch, and pinned the fin and rudder about 3/32\" apart then stuck the tape to the bare wood.  This worked OK but with the edges any closer the hinge was too stiff. I didn't fancy slicing into 1/16\" edge to put a mylar hinge in. What does anyone else use?  The covering goes up to but not over the hinges.\r\n> \r\n> I made a temporary foam \"nose\" to fit over the Bug. It helps it to bounce when I make a poor launch!  Doesn't seem to affect the flight very much an can bef removed when I get better.\r\n>","authorName":"Laurie","date":"August 24, 2011 8:45 AM"},{"id":744,"subject":"Re: Another Bug starts!!","body":"I have the wing built now plus fuselage...next thing is attaching the tail...I have bought Solite covering for the wing.

I don't honesty \r\nremember that it flies differently than the v-tail since I hadn't \r\nused the v-tail for a very long time.  I also had several v-tails \r\nbreak on launch and that is why I developed the conventional tail.\r\n\r\nBefore I installed the gyro, launching the Carbon Bug did require \r\nrudder offset.  That's been a long time also, since I love the way a \r\ngyro assisted launch goes - straight as an arrow.  It is much easier \r\nthan with presets since you only need to focus on one thing: cresting \r\nthe top of the climb.  Unfortunately any weight addition is a penalty \r\nwith this small a glider.\r\n\r\nI've launched my Bug using the full body rotation as hard as I can.  \r\nI really see only a very slight increase in height.  At less than 4 \r\noz, it just runs out of energy.  Even it you through it very hard, \r\nthe result is not much better than a side arm launch, but it's harder \r\non the airplane.  Speaking of awesome, you should see a hard launch \r\nwhen the wing comes off!!!  I swear, the fuselage must go nearly 100 \r\nyards before sticking in the ground like an arrow.  With the full \r\nlength carbon shaft, you can just put the wing back on and continue \r\nflying, as there is no damage.  \r\n\r\nAs I've mentioned before, the only way it really gets damaged is \r\nduring a fumbled catch, where is hits the ground tail first.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n--Colin--\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@y..., \"danstriderfly\" <danstrider@a...> wrote:\r\n> I just tried the convential tail setup as shown in the Carbon Bug \r\n> pics in the photos section.

Steve \r\nhas his v-tail on high-rates and I am trial using a cruciform tail, \r\nmuch like the Carbon Bug photos.  Obviously, this distributes loads \r\nfor the high-stress discus launch (yes, finally full discus launching \r\nnow). \r\n\r\nAnyhow, so Steve is cruising around and I had just landed and was \r\nwatching briefly.  I saw his plane buck up then fall down and told \r\nhim: \"Dude, there was a thermal.\"  With plane in hand, I chucked my \r\ncruciform tail above his plane and started circling, looking for the \r\nair that threw me around the most.  Flying the tarmac and grass-line, \r\nI found what I thought was a thermal and just circled.  You know the \r\nfeeling of circling and not losing altitude; these circles seemed to \r\nbe getting higher, just kinda. \r\n\r\nThey drifted up with me literally banking and yanking the plane in a \r\ncircle to keep it cored.  I flew directly above me, making pitch \r\ndifficult to judge but managed to keep my circles semi-flat.  I \r\nglanced at my watch with the first signs of going up.  Four minutes \r\nlater, I had around 200 feet of altitude, the plane was getting \r\nsmall, and two years of frustrating circles were exaulted with shouts \r\nof \"I caught a thermal, I caught a thermal!\"   \r\n\r\nAfter the few minutes, which last a long time when the plane gets as \r\nhigh as it did, I realized I drifted out of the thermal and realized \r\nmy mistake.  I searched, but must have been under the bubble.  I \r\ngracefully circled down, actually discovering how sink compares to \r\nthermals' lift, and landed on my scotch tape and gravel marred rudder \r\nand fuselage nose.  4:31  Hot Durn.

Would not do much good to take pics of one installed on my Bug as it is very hard to see with my own 1 1/2 eyes let alone get a good digital image of it. \r\n\r\nTo answer your concerns,yes, if you get your spring tension too heavy, it can and will wear on the servo. That is why it served me well to experiment around with different dia. wire and length of the legs to get a good \"TLAR\" for the servos. I use .009 guitar string for my springs on my Bug and MiMi.You don't want it too weak or it will not be able to push against the airflow,but not so heavy that your servos chatter to try to keep it still. What I did was power up a servo, hook a little piece of wire to the horn and tug on it untill it started to whine. Then I SWAGed at anything that would have less than half that pull on the servo and still have enough push to move in the airflow would be shiny. So, to stretch out this long story a bit more, what I came up with was the \"T\" bent spring made from .009 music wire, with 1 1/4\" leg (vertical part of the T) and arms that looked about right to give good anchorage into the stab and control surface. \r\n\r\nI've got dozens of hours on my servos in my Bug and not a trouble one (and their the cheap ones) 2 ea, 5g servos powered by a 150ma 1s LiPo. Get around 50 - 60 minutes flying time a charge from those little guys, so not so much battery draw from them. If their not pulling so hard that the servo wants to fight it, then it uses no more power than what it would to hold a push rod, At least that is what I'm thinking. \r\n\r\nI'll get those pics up soon.\r\n\r\nMark    \r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, John Gallagher <gldrgidr@...> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> I have the same concerns.Â  The constant pressure is considered a good thing for launching but it does sound like a strain on the servo.Â  The same problems occur with the pull-pull method.Â  Mark also mentioned that he had to modify the spring to prevent distortion at the hinge line which is another problem reported with the string/spring method.\r\n> Â \r\n> Mark,\r\n> Can you upload some photos of yourÂ T spring instilation soÂ we can seeÂ the solution you came up with?\r\n> Â \r\n> JohnÂ \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ________________________________\r\n> From: kb11troy <kb10troy@...>\r\n> To: BugHLG@yahoogroups.com \r\n> Sent: Friday, November 18, 2011 4:22 AM\r\n> Subject: [BugHLG] Re: Carbon rods in Dubro micro \"clamp\" for the servo..\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I've wondered about the string/spring method as well.

I'm still here. Not building or flying lately due to losing our field to the soccer hooligans. I've been itching to do another build and this thread popped up. I'm in when the plans are finished.\r\n\r\nI called my small plane the L'il Bugger since it was a hybrid of the Little Nipper and the Bug. I also built a 48\" Bug hybrid that I really enjoyed. I'll add a photo to the photos section of this group as a reminder. I still have this plane. It is no longer prepped for flying, but I keep it as a memento of flying with my boys who are now grown (staring to feel old...)\r\n\r\nAs far as airfoils go, I think we get a little too wound up on design. Unless you are laser cutting, you're going to have some variation anyway and the Bug's wing by design has a massively varying airfoil due to construction method.

As far as I know what follows is common on both sides of the Atlantic. I'm in the UK.\r\n\r\n\"Stringers\" are the, usually, supplementary strips used to give shape to a fuselage in traditional building, say in a scale\r\nmodel, \"Longerons\" are the full length structural fuselage members. The full-span members of a wing are usually called \"spars\", and their use is structural BUT their use in increasing the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing has also been known in modelling for many, many years because of the effect they have of turbulating the flow of air over a wing.  (July & October 1947 Aeromodeller articles talk about them being \"well known\" and the 1938/39 Zaic Yearbook talks about experiments by a Mr Jacobs) See also Wikipedia \"Aifoil Turbulator\" and elsewhere no doubt, for a fuller explanation but basically any spanwise disruption of the flow of air over a wing will induce turbulance in the boundary layer and the effect of this is to reduce drag. Even now in the days of very smooth,regular and even wing surfaces the world-class free flight guys will add \"disruptors\" or \"turbulators\" on their shiny smooth wings by adding one or more very narrow strips of tape along the wing near the leading edge to create this effect. The same effect can of course be built in by using wing spars which will alter the way the covering material covers the wing. Interestingly too, rough wing surfaces can act the same way  so what does this say about the shiny film in almost universal use?\r\n\r\nI know there are also theories about the sagging of covering material between ribs and how this may, or may not, reduce efficiency, and obviously wing spars would reduce this effect. I have it in mind though that, counter-intuitively, this has little effect on the efficiency of a wing  but I could be recalling the article I read wrongly, and I will do some more research if people are interested. Most of this knowledge is within the vintage areomodelling movement where these methods of building are commonplace.  Very little is new in this world  it just has to be re-discovered!

As designated in the plan, .025 would work, but be needlessly heavy. \r\n\r\nMusic wire of the proper diameter can be found by going to your local guitar store and buying single unwound .018 or .016 guitar strings. Probably a buck or two at most for enough to do a Bug.\r\n\r\nAlso, a note on the tubing- if you buy tubing from Tailboom.com, you should realize that it only comes in certain sizes, and you stretch it to reduce it to the size you need. You buy .022 if you expect to use .018 wire, for instance. Stretching is easy, and instructions on how to do it are on the Tailboom website.\r\n\r\nAgain, kudos to all who have been involved in the update of the Bug and the redrawing of the plan.

How about \"Lytnin'Bug\"?  :P\r\n\r\nI personally like Alan's version as it adds a little \"down under\" flavor. I can just hear it with the Kiwi accent. I also like the lightning bolt logo worked into the name.\r\n\r\nThat said, I also prefer his updated tail feathers as well. These little birds need lots of elevator and rudder authority to hand catch well. To me it's another \"evolution\" of the design. Speaking of which, it's kind of a nit, but the control horns seem to be reversed front to back. I was taught to have the rod attach to the horns directly perpendicular to the hinge line.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to the V tail as an option. I'd never build one, as I'm a dyed in the wool SAL guy. As mentioned, the Y tail is too heavy and the cross tail is well proven for anything but a slingshot launch where it tends to hit your hand on release.\r\n\r\nNone of these details are going to hold me up though as I can easily adapt from the plans to suit my tastes.

A layer of .75 oz glass will be attached with the WBPU that I use to seal and color the airframe.\r\n\r\nThe tail will use Alan's updated profiles with larger control surfaces (without holes) and the full flying rudder will have the same span and shape, it'll just be one piece with the chord narrowed. I've poached a very cool V-mount idea from another builder that I'm keen to modify and try. It'll also likely be removable for transport. I'll try to post some photos this weekend if I can find the time to get started.\r\n\r\nI prefer to SAL launch due to a bad knee, so I'll skip the peg and fill the wingtip with more contest balsa for a good thumb grip for SAL or Flip launches.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I'll be making the wing two-piece as well (some Nipper habits die hard...). That'll change the fuse insides a bit as well for the mounting bolts. I'm also using a 1/4\" wrapped CF tube for stiffness as I find the 1/8 pultruded piece too whippy for my tastes.\r\n\r\nThat's about it. Nothing major, just some small changes... :o)\r\n\r\nChris in Seattle\r\n\r\n--- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, John Gallagher <gldrgidr@...> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> Thanks Chris.\r\n> Cheerleader?Â  Just don't ask to see my Pom-Poms.\r\n> Hopefully I've been a little more than just a cheerleader.Â  The Drela based rudder was mine and I've been consulting with Alan off-group.\r\n> Â \r\n> For your bug, are you going with a nipperÂ tail and fuselage?\r\n> Â \r\n> John\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ________________________________\r\n> From: raincityflyer <lewis08@...>\r\n> To: BugHLG@yahoogroups.com \r\n> Sent: Wednesday, March 14, 2012 11:06 AM\r\n> Subject: [BugHLG] Re: V-Tail Must GO!\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Â  \r\n> John - Your point is well taken.\r\n> \r\n> Besides, anyone who wants a v-tail can figure it out by referencing the original plans.\r\n> \r\n> I personally feel that you're more of a cheerleader than anything else.\r\n> \r\n> Keep it up!\r\n> \r\n> Chris in Seattle\r\n> \r\n> --- In BugHLG@yahoogroups.com, John Gallagher <gldrgidr@> wrote:\r\n> >\r\n> > As owner of this group I would be the one that might be in trouble.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  \r\n> > I've had some email discussions with Carl Dowdy, the designer of the original Bug, and he approved our efforts as long as this would be a new design, not just a bug look alike with a different name.ÃÂ  I gave the man my assurance that it would be a new design.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  \r\n> > I've also accepted that the file BugX-V Tail.pdf is aÃÂ design infringement.ÃÂ  The minimal test is whether this plan can be used to build an exactÃÂ copy of the original bug.ÃÂ  It can.ÃÂ  I've always felt the file was in a gray area because it had the X tail on it but now I realize that I was justÃÂ making excuses.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  \r\n> > It's doubtful that RCM or Carl Dowdy would take legal action but I still think we have an obligation to respect the rights to this design.ÃÂ  I realize that it's a pain to get the plans from RCM and that everyone would like to get the plans for freeÃÂ but we can no longer keep this file as-is onÃÂ  the group website.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  \r\n> > I believe that both legally and morally this file must be removed.ÃÂ  I will remove the file BugX-V Tail.pdfÃÂ  in 48 hours.ÃÂ  If someone would like to remove the v-tail from this plan I would accept that it could be uploaded again.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ I know that this is still a gray area solution butÃÂ at least we have made an effort to respect Carl'sÃÂ design.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ \r\n> > Recently in a private email I was called a nazi for trying to force my ideas on this group.ÃÂ  I'm doing my best to promote the interest of this group and still respect theÃÂ original Bug design rights.ÃÂ  This is also why I'm pushing to remove the V-tail from the Lightninbug plans.ÃÂ  As long as the V-tail is on the plans, you can make an argument for the idea that the plan is just a thinly-disguised, stretched version of the Bug and not a new design.ÃÂ ÃÂ  \r\n> > ÃÂ \r\n> > John Gallagher\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > ________________________________\r\n> > From: Squid <littlefr2003@>\r\n> > To: BugHLG@yahoogroups.com \r\n> > Sent: Wednesday, March 14, 2012 4:59 AM\r\n> > Subject: [BugHLG] Questions, Points & Comments\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > ÃÂ  \r\n> > Legal issues, we or i am covered.

Turn your radio on, set the center on your trim and wick a drop of thin CA in each rod end. It sets quickly and you're good to go. I'll try to post some photos for those not familiar with the process.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd never use this set up in a 1.5M DLG as the energy is much higher.

But \r\nthe first time I tryed a gyro, I was hooked!  It make the launch so \r\nsimple it's wonderful.  However, weight is really an issue on a plane \r\nthis small. My carbon Bug is broken and I haven't had time to rebuild \r\nit, but when I do, I will remove the gyro and retry launching without \r\nit.\r\n\r\nI do not remember if I launched without the gyro in the final tail \r\nconfiguration.  However, all non-gyro launches I've made with the Bug \r\nresulted in the plane immediately rolling left to inverted - \r\nresulting in a crash.  Later, I learned about presets and with a \r\nsmall amount of right rudder, the launch without the gyro goes pretty \r\nwell, except that you have to remember to turn ON the preset switch \r\nand then correctly time the point at which the preset switch is \r\nturned off.  The gyro just makes it a real no-brainer for launching - \r\ndead straight and all you have to do is nose over at the top.\r\n\r\nThe first gyro I used was a Century.  I don't remember the actual \r\nweights, but I remember that Century being the lightest available. \r\nNow I'm using the GWS gyro which is few grams heavier, but works more \r\nreliably.  The Century gyro appears to be temperature sensitive.  I'm \r\nin Phoenix, AZ and it's very hot.  Many, many times when I took the \r\nBug out of the car for a quick toss at lunch time, the gyro initiated \r\nin reverse.  I've tested this many times and it appears that once the \r\ngyro cools down, it will initialize  correctly, but I've spent 15-20 \r\nminutes plugging in and unplugging the batteries before the gyro \r\nwould respond correctly.  Holding the gyro in front of the air \r\nconditioner duct for a couple minutes seems to help.

I just used them because I had them on hand.\r\n\r\nI never did test the launch heights with the normal wing which was SAL. The second wing was the extended version with the peg in the rear position from the start. It was launching higher than I was ever able to throw my Gambler, so I put the RAM in it to see what was up.\r\n\r\nIt's not scientific at all because there are so many variables, so I can't say for sure that the boom made the difference, or the peg position, or the pushrods. But it does all work together well.\r\n\r\nThe use of the fishing rod boom wasn't an inspired notion at all. The cheapest pultruded carbon tube of the correct size that I could find was going to cost me $20.00 with shipping factored in, and that annoyed me a lot. Then I thought about cheap Chinese made carbon fishing rods that I had seen at Walmart and took a look. That's how that came about. It just happens to work well, and the tapered boom looks cool to boot. \r\n\r\nI'm convinced that all of the wrapped and tapered tubes we see today are coming from China anyway, so why not take advantage of Walmart's huge economic clout and get it cheaply there?
